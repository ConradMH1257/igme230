            <img src="Hall.jpg" style"width:25%; height:25%;" alt="Hall">
            <h3>Hallway</h3>
            <p class="seto">The work above is a hallway from the game Halo Combat Evolved. I used 3Ds Max to create the hallway with a two week period to start, modify, and finish it. The textures
                for the hallway are all given by 3ds max.
            </p>

            <img src="Animation.PNG" style"width:50%; height:50%;" alt="Game Character">
            <h3>Character Design</h3>
            <p class="sett">The photo above is one of eight different characters I had made for a capstone. The program used is Blender and character here is made with a program that I downloaded with Blender. I then attempted to 
                use a another program that uses the Xbox One Kinect for motion capture.

            <h3>Modeling</h3>
            <p class="setth">
                The two photos above are maded on 3ds max. I was working on this model along with the hallway but due to time I could not get the model detailed, rigged or textured.

            <h3>More Blender Work</h3>
            <p class="setf">More work from blender. This is from the addon sapling and can generate trees of any kind for your use.</p>

            <img src="GameDemo.PNG" style"width:50%; height:50%;" alt="Algo game">
            <h3>Unity</h3>
            <p class="setfi">The image above is from a small game demo I made for Finger lakes community college. The class wanted an enviroment and a character to show off our skills that we learned from
                the lessons we learned from my class.
