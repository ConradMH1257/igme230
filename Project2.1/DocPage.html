            <h2>Goal/Audience</h2>
            <p>The goal of this site is to have a location for people to view my work and see what kind of skills I have.<br>
            The main audience would be Lawley and my family. The next type of audience would be recruiters for companies.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Design">
                <h2>Design Decision</h2>
                <p>I wanted something that was not normal for website and bring out what type of designer I am.<br>
                Some of the decisions you see are the colors for the site itself. Menu layout was changed from being horizontal bar to a vertical bar that would open and close when clicked
            </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Sources</h2>
            <p>Most of the items came from my past projects with the need to look up what I needed to know.
                I did need to use W3schools for some simple stuff on the first attempt of this website.
            </p>
            <h2>Changes Made</h2>
            <p>What I changed on this website first was the color of the site it self. It was blue, now it is more a light brown.<br>
            Another change that was made was the menu. I added a drop down menu and changed the layout from being horizontal to vertical.
            I wanted to add a 3d viewer for my models and a youtube video of my classes capstone. I did fix a number of errors I had before though the art page does have some problems with
        validation. I added a link to the pixel artist but without the feature of click dragging to color the cells. All the pages have a grid layout.
        Removed images that I should have not included.</p>
