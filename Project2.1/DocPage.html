            <h2>Goal/Audience</h2>
            <p>The goal of this site is to have a location for people to view my work and see what kind of skills I have.<br>
            The main audience would be Lawley and my family. The next type of audience would be recruiters for companies.</p>

        <div id="Design">
                <h2>Design Decision</h2>
                <p>I wanted something that was not normal for website and bring out what type of designer I am.<br>
                Some of the decisions you see are the colors for the site itself. Menu layout was changed from being horizontal bar to a vertical bar that would open and close when clicked
